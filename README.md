# botton-tab-navigator-with-icons
react-native starter app with 4 screens button tab navigation with icons 

this is a starter page of native app with 3 screen implement with react-navigation 
These are the steps to follow to setup your react-native app project.
#H2 Initializing The project
1. `react-native init Project_Name`
2. `cd Project_Name `
3. `react-native start`
4. `react-native run-android`

At this point you are ready to start your app is ready to go , in case you are not familliar with the intallation of react-native project please
refere to the doccumentation [React-native cli Quick start or Expo cli Quickstart ](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/getting-started
"react-native getting start") 
***
##H2 Installing react-navigation dependency

5. `npm install --save react-navigation` or `yarn add react-navigation` I myself prefere using yarn.
If you are not familiar with react-navigation installation please refere to the documentation 
[react-navigation doc ](https://reactnavigation.org/docs/en/getting-started.html) 
6. `npm install --save react-native-gestures-handler` or `yarn add react-native-gesture-handler`
if you are not familliar to react-native-gesture-handler please refere to the doc 
[react-native-gesture-handler Getting-started ](https://kmagiera.github.io/react-native-gesture-handler/docs/getting-started.html)
Some time you may be require to link the dependency use `react-native link react-native-gesture-handler` , 
but in most case for react-native >= v60 is not necessary because is automaticaly linked.

***

Now that you are ready to start codiding , the manual approche for me is the best but you can also clone the entire project 


Now you are ready to take your app to the next level this is how it look
